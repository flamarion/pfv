"""Onboarding endpoints (L3.3 first-run wizard).

Endpoints, all auth-required, all scoped to the calling user
and their org:

- ``POST /api/v1/users/me/onboarding/complete``
  Sets ``users.onboarded_at`` to now (UTC). Idempotent — calling again
  re-stamps the timestamp but the frontend will not redirect to
  ``/onboarding`` once it is set.

- ``POST /api/v1/users/me/onboarding/seed-demo``
  Runs ``demo_seed_service.seed_org`` against the caller's org.
  Refuses with 409 ``org_has_data`` when the org already has user
  transactions OR the demo sentinel category is already present.
  Audit-logged on success and on refusal.

  Accepts an ``empty_org_only`` query parameter (default ``true``)
  that documents caller intent for the in-app reseed flow:
   - ``true``  → caller expects the org to already be empty. This
                 is the safe path used by the onboarding wizard and
                 the Settings "Load demo data" affordance.
   - ``false`` → caller has just wiped via
                 ``POST /api/v1/orgs/data/reset`` and expects the
                 seed to succeed. The server does NOT auto-wipe.
  Either way ``seed_org`` enforces emptiness server-side; the param
  is informational and ends up in the audit ``detail`` so we can see
  which flow the user came through.

- ``POST /api/v1/users/me/onboarding/restart-tour``
  Records that the user requested to replay the dashboard tour
  overlay. Server-side this is an audit-only, rate-limited action:
  ``users.onboarded_at`` is intentionally **not** touched, because
  AppShell guards on a NULL ``onboarded_at`` to bounce first-run
  users to ``/onboarding`` — clearing it here would trap the user in
  a redirect loop. The frontend triggers the dashboard tour overlay
  via a sessionStorage flag and a ``/dashboard`` push; this endpoint
  is the recorded, rate-limited server side of that action. A full
  wizard restart is a separate explicit action handled outside this
  endpoint. Idempotent. Per-user. Audit event
  ``onboarding.tour.restarted`` on every call.

Org isolation: the service receives ``current_user.org_id`` directly;
no path or body parameter can override which org gets seeded.
