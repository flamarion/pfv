"""Pure-ASGI middleware that binds a per-request correlation context.

**Why pure ASGI, not BaseHTTPMiddleware.** Starlette's
``BaseHTTPMiddleware`` runs the wrapped app on a separate task via an
internal ``StreamingResponse`` bridge. ``contextvars`` set inside the
handler (e.g. ``user_id`` / ``org_id`` / ``role`` bound by
``deps.get_current_user``) live in that downstream task's context and
do NOT propagate back into the middleware's outer scope. Anything the
outer scope emits afterward — most importantly uvicorn's access log
line, which fires from there — would silently miss the auth fields,
defeating the whole point of L4.9. Pure-ASGI middleware shares the
caller's task and contextvar pool, so a ``bind_contextvars`` inside
the handler stays visible to the outer scope, and the access log
inherits both ``request_id`` and the auth context for free.

Per HTTP request, this middleware:

- Clears structlog's contextvars (fresh per-request scope; never bleed
  state from a previous request that crashed mid-handler).
- Reads ``X-Request-Id`` from the inbound headers if present and it
  passes a strict character-set + length policy; otherwise generates
  a UUID4 hex. Either way the value is bound onto structlog
  contextvars under the ``request_id`` key.
- Stashes the same value on ``scope["state"]["request_id"]`` so
  ``request.state.request_id`` works in any FastAPI handler.
- Echoes the value back as ``X-Request-Id`` on the response so
  callers (frontend, ops) can correlate.

User / org / role context is bound LATER, inside
``deps.get_current_user``. With pure-ASGI semantics here, that
binding stays visible to the outer scope — including uvicorn.access.
