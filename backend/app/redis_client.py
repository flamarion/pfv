"""Redis / Valkey client — singleton, lazy-initialized from settings.

Scope today: MFA email-code single-use nonces + refresh-session primary
key, grace key, and family set (``auth:session:{jti}``,
``auth:session:grace:{jti}``, ``auth:session:by_sid:{sid}``).
More features (rate-limit storage, cache) land here when the app moves
off single-replica on DO App Platform and needs shared state.

Behavior when `settings.redis_url` is empty:
- Development: `get_client()` returns `None`. Callers must handle None and
  decide whether to skip the Redis-backed check (usually yes in dev).
- Production: a runtime warning is logged at startup. The security-critical
  callers (MFA nonce, auth-session writes) MUST fail closed if they need
  Redis and it's missing; see `require_client()` below.

    Idempotent. The client is shared across the process lifetime, the
    underlying connection pool handles concurrency.

    Resilience knobs explained:
    - `socket_keepalive=True`: lets the kernel detect dead peers (Valkey
      restart, droplet reboot, VPC route flap) instead of waiting for the
      next read to time out three seconds in.
    - `health_check_interval=30`: redis-py pings idle pooled connections
      every 30s and discards any that fail, so a Valkey restart does not
      leave half-open sockets sitting in the pool waiting to time out a
      future caller.
    - `retry_on_error` + `retry`: one short backoff retry on connect or
      timeout errors. This makes the dashboard probe and the MFA nonce
      path tolerate a Valkey blip (e.g. an Ansible re-converge that
      bounces the service) instead of surfacing a hard failure on the
      very first stale-pool socket. ``OSError`` (covers
      ``ConnectionResetError`` and ``BrokenPipeError``) is in the retry
      list because production observed those classes on idle-dropped
      sockets — the 2026-05-19T07:10 trace. We deliberately do NOT add
      bare ``RuntimeError`` here because redis-py's retry contract is
      "drop connection + reconnect on listed error"; widening to all
      ``RuntimeError`` would also retry genuine programmer bugs. The
      transport-runtime case is handled instead by the
      ``_normalize_transport_errors`` wrapper at the helper layer.

    **Fail-fast budget (2026-05-19 production trace).** Honest worst case
    accounts for both connect and read on the retry attempt because
    redis-py's ``retry_on_error`` contract drops the connection and

                       + retries * (socket_connect_timeout
                                    + socket_timeout
                                    + backoff_cap)
                       = 1.0 + 1 * (1.0 + 1.0 + 0.2)
                       = 3.2 s

    ``/auth/refresh`` makes up to 7 sequential Redis calls in the
    already_rotated branch after PR #315:

      1. ``session_validate(jti)``                            (validator)
      2. ``session_family_member(sid, jti)``     (validator primary path)
      3. ``session_rotate_lua(...)``                          (rotation)
      4. ``session_grace(old_jti)``                           (re-probe)
      5. ``session_family_exists(sid)``                       (re-probe)
      6. ``session_validate(successor_jti)``        (catch-up helper)
      7. ``session_family_member(sid, successor_jti)`` (catch-up helper)

    Worst case for the already_rotated branch: ``7 * 3.2 = 22.4 s``.
    Direct grace branch is 5 calls: ``5 * 3.2 = 16.0 s``. Normal "ok"
    rotation is 3 calls: ``3 * 3.2 = 9.6 s``. All under the frontend's
    45 s reactive-recovery timer, with at least 20 s margin even in
    the pathological case.

    Earlier values (socket_timeout=3, retries=2, cap=1.0) summed to
    per_call ~= ``3 + 2 * (3 + 3 + 1)`` = ``17 s`` honest worst case,
    7 calls = ~119 s — the requests reached the backend, sat
    retrying past the 45 s frontend cancel, and surfaced as the hung
    "(canceled)" entries in the 2026-05-19T15:25–15:42 trace.

    Tests in ``test_auth_redis_failfast_budget.py`` pin the new
