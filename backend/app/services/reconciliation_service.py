"""Reconciliation service (L3.2 Wave 2B).

Owns the state-machine for post-import reconciliation. The wire shapes
come from ``app.schemas.import_reconciliation`` (frozen in Wave 1, see
``specs/2026-05-12-l3-2-import-contracts.md`` §3). This module is the
authoritative place that:

* creates an ``ImportBatch`` header when CSV / OFX confirm commits a
  batch of transactions,
* validates state-machine transitions and applies them atomically,
* keeps the denormalized ``row_count`` / ``accepted_count`` /
  ``pending_count`` columns in sync as rows transition,
* auto-closes the batch when ``pending_count`` drops to zero.

Public entry points:

* ``create_import_batch(db, org_id, user_id, account_id, source_format,
  file_name, transaction_ids) -> ImportBatch``
* ``reconcile_request(db, org_id, batch_id, request) ->
  ReconcileBatchResponse`` -- top-level handler called from the router.
* ``close_batch_if_complete(db, batch) -> bool`` -- auto-close helper.

The transition table (§3.3 / §3.4) is encoded as ``ALLOWED_TRANSITIONS``
below. Disallowed transitions raise ``ConflictError`` so FastAPI's global
handler maps them to HTTP 409 with the source + target state in the
detail message.

# L3.2 Wave 2B (PR #247 round 4 P1) -- ledger-correct balance bookkeeping.
#
# Imported SETTLED rows applied ``accounts.balance`` at confirm time
# (via ``transaction_service.apply_balance``). The cached balance must
# stay in sync with the **reportable set** of transactions, not with
# the reconciliation state in isolation -- otherwise transitions that
# flip reportability through OTHER paths (e.g. MATCHED setting
# ``linked_transaction_id``) silently desync the cached balance from
# the aggregates the user sees in dashboards / budgets.
#
# Source of truth for "does this row contribute to the cached balance?"
# is ``transaction_filters.is_reportable_transaction``: a row counts
# iff it's reportable. So the balance bookkeeping rule reduces to a
# simple before/after diff:
#
#   source_reportable  target_reportable  action
#   -----------------  -----------------  -------
#         True               True         no-op
#         False              False        no-op
#         True               False        revert_balance
#         False              True         apply_balance
#
# Round 3's ``_BALANCE_KEPT_STATES`` matrix got MATCHED -> ACCEPTED
# wrong: the link was already set on entering MATCHED, so the row was
# already non-reportable, but the matrix re-applied based on state
# alone. Deriving the decision from ``is_reportable_transaction`` is
# correct by construction across every transition.

    reportability diff between before-mutation and after-mutation
    snapshots of the transaction.

    ``source_reportable`` is captured by ``_reconcile_one`` BEFORE any
    state-flip or link-mutation runs. ``target_reportable`` is read
    here AFTER those mutations have landed on the in-memory instance.
    The diff drives the action:

        True  -> True   no-op (still reportable, balance unchanged)
        False -> False  no-op (still excluded, balance unchanged)
        True  -> False  revert_balance (row drops out of reports)
        False -> True   apply_balance  (row enters reports)

    This shape is correct by construction across every state path,
    including the MATCHED -> ACCEPTED case round 3 got wrong: both
    states are non-reportable while ``linked_transaction_id`` is set,
    so the diff is False -> False and no balance change fires.

    Only SETTLED rows ever touched the cached balance at import time,
    so PENDING rows skip this dance entirely (their balance is virtual
    until settlement, handled by the existing forecast / pending-delta
    code path).

    The account row is locked via ``get_account_for_update`` for the
    duration of the revert/apply pair so two concurrent state
    transitions on rows in the same account can't interleave and
    double-mutate the cached balance. The lock is released when the
    outer transaction commits.
