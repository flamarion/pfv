"""Filters and predicates expressing transfer-leg exclusion in aggregates.

Lives in its own module to avoid a circular import with category_rules_service,
which already imports from transaction_service.

Excluded from reportable aggregates:

- Transfer legs (``linked_transaction_id IS NOT NULL``): not income/expense.
  This also covers MATCHED reconciliation rows -- ``_apply_match`` writes
  ``linked_transaction_id`` on the inbox row so the matched-against row
  stays canonical and the imported duplicate disappears from reports.
- Manual balance adjustments (``is_manual_adjustment = True``): controlled
  escape hatch from the "balance from transactions" invariant. Counted by
  ``reconcile_account`` (so stored balance == sum of settled rows holds)
  but excluded from budget/forecast totals because they reflect the act
  of correcting a balance, not actual income or expense activity.
- Reconciliation SKIPPED / REJECTED rows (L3.2 Wave 2B PR #247 P1 fix):
  the row stays in the DB for audit + recoverability, but its amount
  was reverted from ``accounts.balance`` and it must not appear in
  reportable aggregates. ``_RECON_EXCLUDED_STATES`` pins the list so
  future state-machine additions stay coherent.

Future-proofed to grow additional reasons (voided, refunded) without
renaming call sites.
