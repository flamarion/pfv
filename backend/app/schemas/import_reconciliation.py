"""Pydantic schemas for the post-import reconciliation flow (Wave 1 contract).

Frozen per spec at
``~/.claude/projects/-Users-fjorge-src-pfv/specs/2026-05-12-l3-2-import-contracts.md``.

Reconciliation is the post-confirm "inbox" UX. After a CSV or OFX import
commits transactions, those rows are flagged ``reconciliation_state =
PENDING_REVIEW`` (instead of the default ``ACCEPTED``). The Reconciliation
UI presents them as a worklist; the user transitions each row to its final
state via this endpoint.

Wave 2 Reconciliation UI team owns the implementation, the migrations that
add ``transactions.reconciliation_state``, ``transactions.import_batch_id``,
and the ``import_batches`` table. This file freezes the wire shape and the
state-transition rules.
