"""Case-insensitive UNIQUE on organizations.name (Track D org-rename).

Revision ID: 034_unique_org_name
Revises: 033_roles
Create Date: 2026-05-07

Backstory:
    Track D introduces an OWNER-only "rename my org" endpoint
    (PATCH /api/v1/orgs/{org_id}/rename). Two orgs with the same
    canonical name are confusing for cross-tenant features (admin
    surfaces, audit logs, support tickets), so the architect locked
    in a DB-level uniqueness guarantee on the name's lower-cased,
    accent-sensitive form. The router does a friendly preflight 409;
    this constraint is the backstop that survives any race.

MySQL strategy:
    Add a STORED generated column ``name_normalized`` that mirrors
    ``LOWER(name)`` with collation ``utf8mb4_0900_as_cs``. The
    generated column is what carries the UNIQUE constraint. Accent-
    sensitive collation distinguishes "Cafe" from "Café" (the spec's
    decision: no surprising deduplication of distinct trade names).

SQLite strategy:
    SQLite supports virtual generated columns but stored generated
    columns can be platform-flaky on older SQLite builds, and the
    unit-test fixtures use ``aiosqlite`` so we keep it simple: a
    plain UNIQUE INDEX on ``LOWER(name)``. SQLite's LOWER() is
    binary on non-ASCII, which actually mirrors the MySQL accent-
    sensitive behaviour (accents are preserved, only ASCII case is
    folded), so the same dedupe semantics hold for tests.

Defensive precheck:
    Both dialects scan for any existing duplicate (case-insensitive)
    org names before applying the constraint. Pre-launch the only
    seeded data is the local dev DB, but the migration is cheap to
    keep idempotent, and a future re-run on a clobbered dataset
    would bail with a useful error rather than crashing on the DDL.

    the DDL would fail anyway, but this surfaces the offending rows
    up front so an operator can fix them in one pass.

    The actual UNIQUE on MySQL is over ``LOWER(name)`` collated as
    ``utf8mb4_0900_as_cs`` — case-insensitive, accent-sensitive. The
    base ``organizations.name`` column inherits the table's default
    collation (typically ``utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci``, accent-insensitive),
    so a pure ``GROUP BY LOWER(name)`` SQL precheck would falsely flag
    "Cafe" and "Café" as duplicates and block a valid upgrade. Pull
    rows out and group in Python with ``str.lower()`` (accent-
    preserving) to mirror the constraint exactly.
