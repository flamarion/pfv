"""Add users.onboarded_at + backfill existing users.

Revision ID: 042_users_onboarded_at
Revises: 041_opening_balance
Create Date: 2026-05-12

Adds ``users.onboarded_at TIMESTAMP NULL``. Backfills every existing
row with ``onboarded_at = created_at`` so the first-run wizard does
not greet users who already live in the app. New rows default to
NULL — the L3.3 wizard sets it via ``POST
/api/v1/users/me/onboarding/complete`` once the user finishes (or
skips) the flow.

The column is nullable on purpose: NULL means "has not seen
onboarding yet"; a timestamp means "completed at <ts>". A boolean
would lose the audit trail of when the user finished.
