"""L3.2 §6.2 OFX fixture coverage (Wave 2A).

This module is the regression gate for the six synthetic OFX fixtures
listed in the L3.2 spec §6.2. Each fixture exercises a distinct parser
code path:

  * ``rabobank_ofx_1x.ofx``  - OFX 1.x SGML, vanilla checking statement
  * ``ing_ofx_2x.ofx``       - OFX 2.x XML, vanilla checking statement
  * ``chase_credit_card_2x.ofx`` - OFX 2.x XML with ``CCSTMTRS`` (credit
    card) section instead of ``STMTRS`` (deposit account). Validates the
    ``CCACCTFROM`` shape where ``bankid`` may be absent.
  * ``malformed_truncated.ofx`` - structurally invalid OFX 1.x;
    must surface as ``ParseError`` (HTTP 400 at the router boundary).
  * ``large_10k_rows.ofx``  - 10 000-row OFX 2.x XML, the production-
    supported maximum (spec §1.4). Kept on disk as a fixture so the
    inventory regression gate stays green, but NOT exercised by a
    correctness or perf test in this module: the 10k intake contract
    is being decided separately (see
    ``memory/project_next_dev_batch_2026_05_15.md`` → "OFX parser
    scale / isolation contract").
  * ``quicken_qfx.qfx``      - OFX 1.x ``.qfx`` Quicken variant with the
    INTU.BID extension; validates the ``.qfx`` extension is parsed by
    the same code path as ``.ofx`` 1.x SGML.

All fixtures are synthetic per spec §6.2: fictional account numbers
(``NL01TEST...``, ``4111TESTCC...``, etc.) and fictional merchants.
NO real bank data anywhere in this tree.

Tests are intentionally service-layer (``parse_ofx`` direct calls)
rather than router-layer. The router contract is covered exhaustively
by ``backend/tests/routers/test_import_ofx.py``; this module asserts
that the parser itself handles every fixture variant without a HTTP
shell. That way, when the OFX service gets future hardening (e.g. a
new dialect), one test failure points at the parser code, not the
router wiring.
