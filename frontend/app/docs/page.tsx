            <h2 id="overview">What is The Better Decision</h2>
            <p>
              The Better Decision (codename pfv) is a personal finance
              app for households and individuals. It tracks accounts,
              transactions, budgets, and forecasts, all scoped to your
              organization. Categories are the backbone of the model:
              budgets and forecasts ride on top of them, and most
              reporting is grouped by category. The app is pre-launch,
              so copy may be rough and some flows are still evolving.
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Organizations.</strong> Every user belongs to an
                organization. All data (accounts, transactions,
                categories, plans) is scoped to that organization.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Members and roles.</strong> Within an org, users
                are owner, admin, or member. There is also a platform
                superadmin role for operators of the service.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Accounts.</strong> Bank accounts, credit cards,
                cash, savings. Each account has a type and a balance
                derived from its transactions.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Categories.</strong> Hierarchical: master
                categories group related subcategories. Each category
                has a type (income, expense, or both) which constrains
                where it can be used.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Transactions.</strong> Every transaction has a
                purchase date and a settled date. The settled date
                determines which billing period the transaction belongs
                to, which matters for credit cards where the purchase
                and the statement fall in different months.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Recurring transactions.</strong> Templates that
                fire on a cadence (monthly, weekly, biweekly, and so
                on) and generate transactions automatically.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Forecasts and budgets.</strong> Budgets are the
                current-period control surface. Forecast plans are
                forward-looking projections per category, used by the
                dashboard to show what the period is on track for.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2 id="common-workflows">Common workflows</h2>

            <h3>Importing a CSV</h3>
            <p>
              From the Import page, upload a CSV from your bank. The
              app parses the file, suggests categories where it can
              (auto-categorization), and shows a preview before
              anything is written. Confirm the preview to commit the
              rows as transactions.
            </p>

            <h3>Editing a transaction inline</h3>
            <p>
              On the Transactions page, click a row to expand the
              inline editor. You can change the amount, dates,
              category, and notes without leaving the list.
            </p>

            <h3>Promoting a transaction to recurring</h3>
            <p>
              When editing a transaction, the inline row exposes a
              "Promote to recurring" action that turns the transaction
              into a recurring template, so the same charge generates
              automatically next period.
            </p>

            <h3>Marking transactions as a transfer pair</h3>
            <p>
              When money moves between two of your own accounts, you
              can either record the pair from the start (Add transfer)
              or convert an existing transaction by selecting its
              counterparty. The pair is then excluded from
              category-level spending so transfers do not double-count.
            </p>

            <h3>Setting up a forecast plan</h3>
            <p>
              From the Forecast Plans page, create a plan for the
              current or upcoming period. Categories pull from past
              activity and recurring templates as starting points;
              edit the per-category amount to match your expectation
              and save.
            </p>

            <h3>Reviewing the dashboard verdict</h3>
            <p>
              The dashboard summarizes the period with an On Track
              verdict that anchors on what has actually settled, not
              just what is projected. Below the verdict, a Forecast
              card shows your expected month-end balance per account
              (current balance plus pending items in the period), and
              a Forecast by Category card highlights how planned and
              actual compare for your top expense categories.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Dashboard intentionally stays light on technical
              detail. For variance numbers, source attribution, the
              planned vs actual chart, and the refresh-from-sources
              control, open the Forecast Plans page and turn on Show
              details.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2 id="forecasts">Forecasts: planning vs projecting</h2>
            <p>
              The Forecasts area can feel confusing at first because four
              ideas overlap: the plan, the projection, the variance, and
              the two buttons that fill the plan in. Here is each one in
              the simplest words.
            </p>
            <p>
              Where you see what: the Dashboard answers household
              questions visually (are we on track, where will we end the
              month, which accounts and categories explain that). The
              Forecast Plans page is where you build and adjust the
              plan itself. Forecast Plans starts in a simple view and
              has a Show details toggle that reveals variance numbers,
              source attribution, the planned vs actual chart, and the
              refresh-from-sources control when you need them.
            </p>

            <h3>The plan is your wish list</h3>
            <p>
              A plan is a wish list with numbers. You write down what you
              want to spend on each category for the period. For example,
              "I want to spend 600 on groceries this month and 80 on
              coffee." That is the plan. Saving the plan does not move
              any money. It just records your intention.
            </p>

            <h3>Auto-populate fills the wish list for you</h3>
            <p>
              When you create a brand new plan, the wish list is empty.
              Click <strong>Auto-populate</strong> and the app fills it
              in for you. It looks at three things, in order, for each
              master category:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <strong>Recurring bills</strong> that will fire in the
                period (rent, Netflix, salary). Their amounts are added
                up.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Your last 3 months of activity</strong>, averaged.
                Used for categories that don't have a recurring bill.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Whatever you've already booked in this period</strong>,
                blended in with the past 3 months so the suggestion reflects
                your most recent reality. A category can be seeded from
                current-period activity alone, even if it has no 3-month
                history.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              Each row in the plan shows where its number came from: a
              recurring template, your history (labeled "Auto"), or a
              manual edit you made.
            </p>

            <h3>Variance: did you stick to the wish list</h3>
            <p>
              Variance compares your plan to what actually happened.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                You planned 600 for groceries and spent 400 so far.
                Variance is 200 under plan, shown in green. You have
                room to spare.
              </li>
              <li>
                You planned 600 for groceries and spent 700. Variance
                is 100 over plan, shown in red. You went past the
                number you wrote down.
              </li>
              <li>
                For income, the colors flip. Earning more than you
                planned is good (green), earning less is amber or red.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Projected: the app's best guess for end of month</h3>
            <p>
              The Projected number on the dashboard is a totally
              different idea from the plan. The plan is what you want
              to spend. Projected is what the app thinks will actually
              happen by the end of the month, given everything it can
              already see. It is the sum of:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Settled</strong>: what has already cleared.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Pending</strong>: charges that have been booked
                but not yet cleared (a card swipe waiting on the
                statement, a manual upcoming expense you typed in).
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Scheduled recurring</strong>: every recurring
                bill that will fire from now until the end of the
                period.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              <strong>
                Projected is not Planned Income minus Planned Expenses.
              </strong>{" "}
              It can be higher than your plan if pending charges or
              upcoming recurring bills are bigger than you expected, or
              lower if life has been quiet and not many bills are
              scheduled. Treat Projected as a heads-up, not a verdict.
              The dashboard's On Track verdict reads from what has
              actually settled, so a noisy projection won't alarm you
              before any money has moved.
            </p>

            <h3>Refresh from sources: re-check after life changes</h3>
            <p>
              Auto-populate is for the very first fill. Refresh from
              sources is for later. Use it when something about your
              setup has changed since you first built the plan. Maybe
              you added a new subscription, ended an old one, edited
              the amount of a recurring bill, or imported new
              transactions that should feed the average.
            </p>
            <p>
              Refresh drops every row whose source is Recurring or Auto
              (the rows the system filled in) and re-runs Auto-populate
              against today's templates and history. Rows you typed or
              edited yourself are kept untouched. Categories that have
              shown up since the first populate will be added in this
              pass too.
            </p>
            <p>
              Refresh from sources is part of the details view on the
              Forecast Plans page (turn on Show details to see it).
              On a draft plan, Refresh runs immediately. On a finalized
              plan, Refresh opens an Edit and refresh confirmation that
              reverts the plan to draft, refreshes the auto-generated
              rows, and keeps the lines you added or edited yourself.
              If the refresh step fails after the revert, the plan is
              left in draft and the error is shown so you can retry or
              continue editing manually.
